# Microsoft Corporation

Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington. It was founded on April 4, 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, and has become one of the world's most influential and valuable technology companies. Microsoft is widely known for its software products, especially the Microsoft Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite of productivity software. However, the company has diversified its business over the years and now offers a wide range of products and services in the technology sector.

## History

### Early Years (1975-1985)
In 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen saw the potential of personal computing and started Microsoft to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. The company quickly gained success and secured a significant contract with IBM to provide the operating system for their personal computers. In 1980, Microsoft signed a contract granting IBM rights to MS-DOS, an operating system for IBM PCs. This partnership proved to be a turning point for Microsoft, as it established the company as a major player in the PC market.

During this period, Microsoft also introduced the first version of Microsoft Word and the Windows operating system. Windows 1.0, released in 1985, was the first version of the graphical user interface-based operating system that would eventually dominate the global PC market.

### Growth and Dominance (1985-2000)
The late 1980s and 1990s were a period of tremendous growth for Microsoft. The release of Windows 3.0 in 1990 made the operating system more user-friendly and popular, solidifying Microsoft's position in the market. The company also expanded its product portfolio with the introduction of Microsoft Office, which bundled Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single suite.

In 1995, Microsoft released Windows 95, which became an instant success and further strengthened the company's market dominance. The launch of Internet Explorer in the same year marked Microsoft's entry into the burgeoning internet browser market. The browser's integration with Windows gave it a significant advantage, and it soon became the most widely used web browser.
